# hr-retention-ann

Employee attrition is very important. Companies spend lots of resources, money and valuable time to train their employees to get the best results and hence if the employee leaves the company due to some reason it is a great loss of human resource for the company. Therefore, understanding why employees leave is very important for businesses to maximize efficiency and reduce training cost which translates into greater profit. The following question is the one we would like answered: Can we predict future terminations? If so, how well can we predict? 

## Language: Python 

## Version: Python 2.7 

## Libraries:-  

* numpy  
* pandas 
* seaborn 
* matplotlib.pyplot 
* sklearn 
* sklearn.metrics 
* sklearn.tree 
* sklearn.ensemble 
* csv 
* keras.models 
* keras.layers 
* random 
* math

## Result

From our analysis we found what type of people leave their job. And what are the values of different parameters for these employees like they have high salary or low. With the help of data companies can take steps to prevent their employees from leaving the company using algorithms in machine learning like SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network.
